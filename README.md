## Mutli-Channel Radar Echo Extrapolation with Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (TensorFlow-1.12.0)
**Data**: Radar Image Sequence\
  However, the current version has no data sample for demonstrating. It is able to check the graph-building in TensorFlow by calling `Train_FullEpoch.py`\
**Methods**: Covolutional RNN (ConvRNN)
  - ConvGRU
  - ConvLSTM
  - TrajGRU
  - PredRNN
  - PredRNN++
  - and more.
